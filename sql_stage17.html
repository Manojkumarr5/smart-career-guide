    <h2>Step 17: Practice SQL Interview Questions</h2>
    <p>
      In this stage you convert your SQL knowledge into interview strength by
      solving common coding and theory questions on your own tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      Focus on recognizing patterns such as filters, joins, aggregates, and
      subqueries instead of memorizing fixed answers.
    </p>

    <hr><br>

    <h3>1️⃣ Basic query and filtering questions</h3>
    <p>
      Interviews usually start with SELECT and WHERE questions that test your
      comfort with basic row filtering.
    </p>

    <pre>
-- Q1: list all CSE students with cgpa >= 8.0
SELECT id, name, branch, cgpa
FROM students
WHERE branch = 'CSE'
  AND cgpa >= 8.0;

-- Q2: fetch students whose name starts with 'A'
SELECT id, name
FROM students
WHERE name LIKE 'A%';

-- Q3: show students who are not from CSE or ECE
SELECT id, name, branch
FROM students
WHERE branch NOT IN ('CSE', 'ECE');
    </pre>

    <p class="note">
      Similar questions appear for employees, products, or orders tables using
      WHERE, IN/NOT IN, BETWEEN, and LIKE.
    </p>

    <h3>2️⃣ JOIN and relationship questions</h3>
    <p>
      Next, interviewers check whether you can combine related tables using joins
      to answer business-style questions.
    </p>

    <pre>
-- Q4: list students who have at least one marks record
SELECT DISTINCT s.id, s.name
FROM students AS s
JOIN marks    AS m
  ON s.id = m.student_id;

-- Q5: list students who do NOT have any marks record
SELECT s.id, s.name
FROM students AS s
LEFT JOIN marks AS m
  ON s.id = m.student_id
WHERE m.student_id IS NULL;

-- Q6: fetch student names with their total marks
SELECT s.name,
       SUM(m.score) AS total_score
FROM students AS s
JOIN marks    AS m
  ON s.id = m.student_id
GROUP BY s.name;
    </pre>

    <p class="note">
      Patterns like “in A but not in B” or “join then aggregate per group” show
      up frequently in analytics and engineering interviews.
    </p>

    <h3>3️⃣ Aggregation, GROUP BY, and HAVING</h3>
    <p>
      Many questions use COUNT, SUM, AVG, GROUP BY, and HAVING to check your
      ability to summarize and filter groups.
    </p>

    <pre>
-- Q7: count students in each branch
SELECT branch,
       COUNT(*) AS total_students
FROM students
GROUP BY branch;

-- Q8: branches with average cgpa >= 8.0
SELECT branch,
       AVG(cgpa) AS avg_cgpa
FROM students
GROUP BY branch
HAVING AVG(cgpa) >= 8.0;

-- Q9: find duplicate emails in users table
SELECT email,
       COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM users
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
    </pre>

    <p class="note">
      Variations include “top N by some metric”, “find duplicates”, and “filter
      groups using HAVING after GROUP BY”.
    </p>

    <h3>4️⃣ Subquery and top‑N questions</h3>
    <p>
      Subqueries appear in tasks like “above average”, “nth highest value”, or
      comparing against aggregated results.
    </p>

    <pre>
-- Q10: students with cgpa above overall average
SELECT name, branch, cgpa
FROM students
WHERE cgpa > (
    SELECT AVG(cgpa)
    FROM students
);

-- Q11: top 3 students by total score
SELECT name, total_score
FROM (
    SELECT s.name,
           SUM(m.score) AS total_score
    FROM students AS s
    JOIN marks    AS m
      ON s.id = m.student_id
    GROUP BY s.name
) AS t
ORDER BY total_score DESC
LIMIT 3;
    </pre>

    <p class="note">
      The same idea is reused for employees with above-average salary or
      customers with top revenue.
    </p>

    <h3>5️⃣ Theory and scenario-style questions</h3>
    <p>
      You will also face short theory and scenario questions to test core
      concepts and communication skills.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Explain the difference between WHERE and HAVING with a simple grouped query.</li>
      <li>Explain INNER JOIN vs LEFT JOIN using a students/marks example.</li>
      <li>Explain DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP at a high level: row-level delete, table reset, and structure removal.</li>
      <li>Discuss how to speed up a slow query: indexes, avoiding SELECT *, better filters, and reviewing execution plans.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">
      Practice answering aloud in simple language; interviewers care about clear
      explanations as much as correct SQL.
    </p>

    <div class="task-box">
      <strong>🎯 Mini Tasks for SQL Stage 17:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a file like <code>sql_interview_practice.sql</code> and run your solutions to Q1–Q11 on your own database.</li>
        <li>Pick five extra questions from any online SQL interview list and solve them using your <code>students</code>, <code>marks</code>, or project tables.[web:313][web:314]</li>
        <li>Choose one JOIN, one GROUP BY, and one subquery question and practice explaining your solution step by step as in a real interview.</li>
        <li>Time yourself: try to solve five questions in 30 minutes to simulate interview pressure.</li>
        <li>Optional: Upload your question set and answers to GitHub as “SQL Interview Practice” to showcase ongoing preparation.</li>
