    <h2>Step 15: Work on DB Projects (Library, HR System)</h2>
    <p>
      In this stage you use everything you learned to design and build small real
      databases, such as a Library Management System or an HR (employee) system.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will define tables, constraints, and relationships, then write practical
      queries that feel like real work, not just classroom exercises.
    </p>

    <hr><br>

    <h3>1️⃣ Project option 1: Library Management System</h3>
    <p>
      A library system tracks books, members, and borrowings, which is ideal to
      practice tables, joins, and date handling.
    </p>

    <pre>
-- members (students) table
CREATE TABLE members (
    member_id   INT PRIMARY KEY,
    full_name   VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    branch      VARCHAR(50),
    year        INT,
    email       VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);

-- books table
CREATE TABLE books (
    book_id     INT PRIMARY KEY,
    title       VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    author      VARCHAR(100),
    category    VARCHAR(50),
    pub_year    INT
);

-- borrowings table
CREATE TABLE borrowings (
    borrow_id   INT PRIMARY KEY,
    member_id   INT,
    book_id     INT,
    borrow_date DATE,
    return_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (member_id) REFERENCES members(member_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id)   REFERENCES books(book_id)
);
    </pre>

    <p class="note">
      This schema lets you practice joins, GROUP BY, and date filters to understand
      borrowing patterns and member behavior.
    </p>

    <h3>2️⃣ Library project – example queries</h3>
    <p>
      Once the tables are ready, you can write queries that might appear in a real
      library dashboard or report.
    </p>

    <pre>
-- list all currently borrowed books (not yet returned)
SELECT b.title,
       m.full_name,
       br.borrow_date
FROM borrowings AS br
JOIN books   AS b ON br.book_id   = b.book_id
JOIN members AS m ON br.member_id = m.member_id
WHERE br.return_date IS NULL;

-- count books borrowed by each member
SELECT m.full_name,
       COUNT(*) AS total_borrowed
FROM members AS m
JOIN borrowings AS br ON m.member_id = br.member_id
GROUP BY m.full_name
ORDER BY total_borrowed DESC;

-- most popular books (by times borrowed)
SELECT b.title,
       COUNT(*) AS times_borrowed
FROM books AS b
JOIN borrowings AS br ON b.book_id = br.book_id
GROUP BY b.title
ORDER BY times_borrowed DESC;
    </pre>

    <p class="note">
      These queries can later be used in reports, dashboards, or portfolio
      documentation for your library project.
    </p>

    <h3>3️⃣ Project option 2: HR / Employee System</h3>
    <p>
      An HR system tracks employees, departments, and salaries and is one of the
      most common beginner SQL project ideas.
    </p>

    <pre>
-- departments table
CREATE TABLE departments (
    dept_id     INT PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name   VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    location    VARCHAR(100)
);

-- employees table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id      INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name  VARCHAR(50),
    last_name   VARCHAR(50),
    email       VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    hire_date   DATE,
    salary      DECIMAL(10,2),
    dept_id     INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES departments(dept_id)
);
    </pre>

    <p class="note">
      You can extend this schema with job titles, managers, attendance, or salary
      history to make it closer to real enterprise systems.
    </p>

    <h3>4️⃣ HR project – example queries</h3>
    <p>
      With these tables you can answer typical HR questions using SELECT, JOIN,
      GROUP BY, and date filters.
    </p>

    <pre>
-- list employees with their department name
SELECT e.emp_id,
       e.first_name,
       e.last_name,
       d.dept_name,
       e.salary
FROM employees AS e
JOIN departments AS d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

-- total salary cost by department
SELECT d.dept_name,
       SUM(e.salary) AS total_salary
FROM departments AS d
JOIN employees  AS e ON d.dept_id = e.dept_id
GROUP BY d.dept_name
ORDER BY total_salary DESC;

-- employees who joined after a specific date
SELECT emp_id,
       first_name,
       last_name,
       hire_date
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date > '2022-01-01'
ORDER BY hire_date;
    </pre>

    <p class="note">
      These kinds of queries mirror real interview and on-the-job reporting needs
      such as staff distribution, salary budgets, and recent hires.
    </p>

      <strong>🎯 Mini Tasks for SQL Stage 15:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose either the Library or HR project and create all tables with appropriate primary and foreign keys in your database.</li>
        <li>Insert at least 20–50 rows across the tables with realistic sample data so that reports look meaningful.</li>
        <li>Write at least 10 queries that answer real questions such as top borrowers, popular categories, highest‑paying departments, or newest employees.</li>
        <li>Save your CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements in one <code>.sql</code> file and your analytical queries in another inside a project folder.</li>
        <li>In your notebook or README, describe the project goal, tables, relationships, and list the key business questions your SQL solves.</li>
      </ul>
