    <h2>Step 7: Use GROUP BY, HAVING, and Aggregation Functions</h2>
    <p>
      In this stage you learn how to summarize data using aggregate functions
      like <code>COUNT</code>, <code>SUM</code>, <code>AVG</code>, <code>MIN</code>, and <code>MAX</code>, together with
      <code>GROUP BY</code> and <code>HAVING</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      These tools let you answer questions such as “average CGPA by branch” or
      “how many students scored above a certain value”.
    </p>

    <hr><br>

    <h3>1️⃣ Aggregate functions basics</h3>
    <p>
      Aggregate functions take many rows and return a single value such as a
      count, sum, or average.
    </p>

    <pre>
-- count all students
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_students
FROM students;

-- average cgpa of all students
SELECT AVG(cgpa) AS avg_cgpa
FROM students;

-- minimum and maximum cgpa
SELECT MIN(cgpa) AS min_cgpa,
       MAX(cgpa) AS max_cgpa
FROM students;
    </pre>

    <p class="note">
      COUNT(*) counts all rows, while COUNT(column) counts only rows where that
      column is not NULL.
    </p>

    <h3>2️⃣ GROUP BY – summarize by category</h3>
    <p>
      GROUP BY groups rows that share the same values in one or more columns
      and then applies aggregates per group.
    </p>

    <pre>
-- average cgpa by branch
SELECT branch,
       AVG(cgpa) AS avg_cgpa
FROM students
GROUP BY branch;

-- number of students per branch
SELECT branch,
       COUNT(*) AS students_in_branch
FROM students
GROUP BY branch;
    </pre>

    <p class="note">
      Every column in the SELECT list must be either inside an aggregate function
      or listed in the GROUP BY clause.
    </p>

    <h3>3️⃣ GROUP BY with multiple columns</h3>
    <p>
      You can group by more than one column, for example branch together with
      year_of_study or gender.
    </p>

    <pre>
-- example table students_extended with (branch, year_of_study)
-- count students per branch and year
SELECT branch,
       year_of_study,
       COUNT(*) AS total_students
FROM students_extended
GROUP BY branch, year_of_study
ORDER BY branch, year_of_study;
    </pre>

    <p class="note">
      The GROUP BY columns define the “level” of summarization that appears
      in the result.
    </p>

    <h3>4️⃣ HAVING – filter after grouping</h3>
    <p>
      HAVING filters groups after aggregation, similar to how WHERE filters
      individual rows before grouping.
    </p>

    <pre>
-- branches where average cgpa is at least 8.0
SELECT branch,
       AVG(cgpa) AS avg_cgpa
FROM students
GROUP BY branch
HAVING AVG(cgpa) >= 8.0;

-- branches with more than 5 students
SELECT branch,
       COUNT(*) AS total_students
FROM students
GROUP BY branch
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
    </pre>

    <p class="note">
      Use WHERE to filter rows before grouping and HAVING to filter the aggregated
      groups, especially when using aggregate functions in conditions.
    </p>

    <h3>5️⃣ Combined example: WHERE + GROUP BY + HAVING</h3>
    <p>
      In real scenarios you often filter rows, group them, filter groups, and
      finally sort the summary in one query.
    </p>

    <pre>
-- average cgpa by branch for only CSE and ECE students,
-- but show only branches where avg_cgpa >= 8.0, sorted by avg_cgpa
SELECT branch,
       AVG(cgpa) AS avg_cgpa
FROM students
WHERE branch IN ('CSE', 'ECE')
GROUP BY branch
HAVING AVG(cgpa) >= 8.0
ORDER BY avg_cgpa DESC;
    </pre>

    <p class="note">
      A useful mental execution order is:
      WHERE (filter rows) → GROUP BY (group rows) → HAVING (filter groups) → ORDER BY (sort results).
    </p>

    <div class="task-box">
      <strong>🎯 Mini Tasks for SQL Stage 7:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Write a query to show <code>branch</code> and <code>COUNT(*)</code> for students grouped by branch.</li>
        <li>Write a query to show <code>branch</code> and <code>AVG(cgpa)</code> and filter with HAVING so that only branches with average CGPA ≥ 8.0 appear.</li>
        <li>If you have a marks or attendance table, get total marks per student or total attendance days per student using GROUP BY and SUM/COUNT.</li>
        <li>Combine WHERE and GROUP BY, for example group only final‑year students by branch and count them.</li>
        <li>In your notebook, write one “story” query in words (for example, “find total fees collected per branch where total &gt; some amount”) and then implement it using GROUP BY plus HAVING.</li>
      </ul>
