    <h2>Step 8: Write Subqueries and Nested Queries</h2>
    <p>
      In this stage you learn how to write subqueries (queries inside another query)
      to answer slightly more complex questions, plus a very small introduction to CTEs
      (WITH).
    </p>
    <p>
      Subqueries are useful when one query needs the result of another query, such as
      “students with above‑average CGPA”.
    </p>

    <hr><br>

    <h3>1️⃣ What is a subquery?</h3>
    <p>
      A subquery is a query nested inside another SQL statement, often in the WHERE,
      FROM, or SELECT clause.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The inner query runs first and produces a result set or single value.[web:226]</li>
      <li>The outer query then uses that result to filter or compute its final output.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2️⃣ Subquery in WHERE – compare with a single value</h3>
    <p>
      A common pattern is to use a subquery in WHERE to compare against an aggregate
      such as a maximum or average.
    </p>

    <pre>
-- students with cgpa equal to the maximum cgpa
SELECT name, branch, cgpa
FROM students
WHERE cgpa = (
    SELECT MAX(cgpa)
    FROM students
);

-- students with cgpa above overall average
SELECT name, branch, cgpa
FROM students
WHERE cgpa > (
    SELECT AVG(cgpa)
    FROM students
);
    </pre>

    <p class="note">
      Here the inner query returns a single value (MAX or AVG), and the outer query
      compares each row’s cgpa with that value.
    </p>

    <h3>3️⃣ Subquery with IN – filter by a list</h3>
    <p>
      When the subquery returns multiple values, you typically use operators like IN
      or NOT IN to filter rows based on that list.
    </p>

    <pre>
-- students who have at least one marks record
SELECT name
FROM students
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT student_id
    FROM marks
);

-- students who currently have no marks
SELECT name
FROM students
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT student_id
    FROM marks
);
    </pre>

    <p class="note">
      The inner query on <code>marks</code> returns a list of student_id values, and the
      outer query keeps only matching or non‑matching students.
    </p>

    <h3>4️⃣ Subquery in FROM – derived table</h3>
    <p>
      A subquery in the FROM clause acts like a temporary table whose result you
      can query again, which helps break complex logic into clear steps.
    </p>

    <pre>
-- first compute average score per student in a subquery,
-- then select only those with avg_score >= 80
SELECT t.student_id,
       t.avg_score
FROM (
    SELECT student_id,
           AVG(score) AS avg_score
    FROM marks
    GROUP BY student_id
) AS t
WHERE t.avg_score >= 80;
    </pre>

    <p class="note">
      Many people find this easier to read: first imagine the inner query’s result
      as a table, then filter it in the outer query.
    </p>

    <h3>5️⃣ Very short intro to CTE (WITH)</h3>
    <p>
      A Common Table Expression (CTE) is like a named subquery defined with WITH,
      which can make complex queries more readable and reusable.
    </p>

    <pre>
-- same idea as the previous example but with a CTE
WITH avg_marks AS (
    SELECT student_id,
           AVG(score) AS avg_score
    FROM marks
    GROUP BY student_id
)
SELECT student_id,
       avg_score
FROM avg_marks
WHERE avg_score >= 80;
    </pre>

    <p class="note">
      CTEs are widely used in modern SQL to improve readability and can be referenced
      multiple times within the same query.

      <strong>🎯 Mini Tasks for SQL Stage 8:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Write a subquery in WHERE to list all students whose cgpa is above the overall average cgpa.</li>
        <li>Write a query that shows students who have at least one marks record using a subquery with IN.</li>
        <li>Write a query that shows students who do not have any marks using NOT IN.</li>
        <li>Create a derived table (subquery in FROM) that calculates average score per student and then filters for avg_score ≥ 80.</li>
        <li>Optional: Rewrite the derived‑table query as a CTE using WITH and compare which version feels easier to read.</li>
